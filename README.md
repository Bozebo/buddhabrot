# buddhabrot
Renders Buddhabrot fractals
Example outputs are available at [bozebo.com/buddhabrots](http://bozebo.com/buddhabrots).

This version will only build on Linux systems right now (tested on Debian Jessie), with .bmp output currently disabled.
settings.xml, OpenSansSemibold.raw and OpenSansSemibold.xml must exist within the working directory of the executable or it will exit on launch (leaving error files behind to trace the problem). Additionally, GLFW3 and GLEW are dependencies.


Usage instructions are currently included in settings.xml
